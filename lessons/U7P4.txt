 Li Xiang, what are you doing on the computer? (妈妈：李翔，你在电脑上做什么呢？)
 I’m shopping for the school party. (李翔：我在为学校派对买东西。)
 What do you need to buy? (妈妈：你需要买什么？)
 I’m looking for a new shirt. What about this blue one? (李翔：我在找一件新衬衫。这件蓝色的怎么样？)
 It’s great for the party. How much is it? (妈妈：很适合派对。多少钱？)
 It’s 65 yuan. Everything is on sale. Look at this pair of shoes. It is 180 yuan. (李翔：65 元。所有东西都在促销。看这双鞋，180 元。)
 Well, that’s a lot of money. I don’t think you need it. You have new shoes. Why not buy a pair of trousers? (妈妈：嗯，太贵了。我觉得你不需要。你有新鞋了。为什么不买条裤子呢？)
 Good idea. But I don’t like the trousers in this online shop. (李翔：好主意。但我不喜欢这家网店的裤子。)
 How about going to the shopping mall this Sunday? (妈妈：这个周日去购物中心怎么样？)
 OK. (李翔：好的。)
